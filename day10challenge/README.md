## What will I learn

Today we will be learning how to Squash long commits by utilizing the `$ git rebase` feature!

#### Brief Overview

Basically Rebasing is a feature in Git that makes **REWRITING** commit history possible. Squashing on
the other hand is simply turning long commits into one. Get the gist?

#### Task

- create a new branch in your local repo

- Write some random things if you like (i.e make modifications)
- commit upto 5 times for different changes to your submssion file
- Squash the commits using Git Rebase feature

#### How to Submit

- Take screenshots of the whole process and link them in your submission file

> Remember to fork this repo if you've not previously and create a new branch for your submission
